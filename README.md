# Welcome to my website

My name is Jamie Shepherd. I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [Fandom](https://fandom.com).

### This site

This is the 2023 version of my website. You should be able to navigate everything using the CLI at the top of the site. I'm thinking of more creative and innovative ways to navigate - if you have any thoughts, get in touch! The entire source code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/jamieshepherd/jamiesh23).
